        <h1>Evaluate the landscape and edit it to reflects the currents conditions on the ground using the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle</h1>
        <p>Now that we have our landscape, we can make edits if necessary so it reflects our landscapes existing condition as close as possible. For your own landscape, you’ll have your own editing to do, but for this hypothetical example, we’ll say that we want to reduce the canopy cover in all TU5 areas by 5%.</p>
        <p>Proceed through the steps below starting with 'Haypress LF2012 Unedited', and name the newly edited version 'Haypress LF2012 EC' (the EC is short for Existing Condition).</p>
        <div class="notificationImportant">
            <p><strong>Important!</strong> Be deliberate in the rules you apply when editing landscapes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Rules are applied based on the order in which you add them. Default Treatment and Disturbance rules are always applied first. If Default rules overlap each other the last (latest) rule is retained, prior Default rules in the same editing session may be ignored.  If user-created rules overlap each other, the first rule is retained.</li>
                <li value="2">After applying rules to a given landscape you should always validate that your changes have been made as you intended. If you are unsure of the effect of the rules you apply, consider saving a version of your landscape after each edit to allow for easy comparison of the changes made by each edit rule you apply.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For further detail see the '<a href="../../Concepts/RuleOrdering.htm" target="_blank">Rule Ordering Considerations</a>' and the '<a href="../../PCLandscapeEval/LandscapeEditTechTopic.htm">Rule Technical Documentation</a>' Topics</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notificationNote">
            <p>You may create your own landscape edit rules by selecting specific conditions, and specifying what modifications to make where ever those conditions occur.</p>
            <p>To split the view and display your mapped area on the left, and this interface on the right, select the <img src="../../Resources/Images/treatment_compare/button_showsplitmap.png" alt="show split map button" class="button" /><span class="UIcomponent">show split map</span> button at the top left of the page. </p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li value="1">Begin by selecting your <span class="UIcomponent">Starting Landscape</span> which you would like to edit</li>
            <li value="2">View the Add Landscape Rule options by either selecting the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Landscape&#160;Edit Rule +</span> sign just below the starting landscape field, or select the dropdown arrow to the far right of the <span class="UIcomponent">Add Landscape&#160;Edit Rule</span> heading.</li>
            <li value="3">Specify the conditions you would like to select in the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Where these conditions exist</span>. In this example we have selected 'Fuel Model' as the Attribute, 'is equal to' as the Operator and fire behavior fuel model '165 (TU5)' as the Value. This selected all TU5 fuel modeled areas across the landscape.</li>
            <li value="4">Specify the conditions you would like to change by populating the fields below <span class="UIcomponent">Modify the following values</span>. In this example we have selected 'Canopy Cover' as the Attribute, 'decrease by' as the Operator, and '5' (for 5 percent) as the Value. For all TU5 fuel modeled areas, we will decrease the canopy cover by 5 percent. </li>
            <li value="5">The <span class="UIcomponent">Apply to Landscape Mask</span> (optional) dropdown allows you to select a shapefile to which these edits will be contained. If this is left blank, the edits will be applied to the entire landscape.</li>
            <li value="6">When you are ready to apply this rule select the <span class="UIcomponent">Add to Rules</span> button. Notice the rule has been added to you list, and the order noted. You can delete rules before saving by using the delete button <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscape_edits/button_delete.png" alt="delete button" /> to the right of each rule. </li>
            <div>
                <div class="notificationImportant">
                    <p>Rules are applied top to bottom, first by Default Fuels Treatment / Disturbance Edit Rules then by user defined Landscape Edit Rules. Currently there is no way to order your rules other than by the order in which you enter them, so be deliberate about how you apply rules and in what order you enter them.</p>
                </div>
                <p>As rules are added, will see them listed at the to of the page, along with the order they have been added, and a notification to let you know the new rule has been successfully saved.</p>

        <h2>Identify a priority treatment area using the Auto97th fire behavior summary and examining Wildland Urban Interface Areas in Map Studio</h2>
        <p>To identify the areas that would be good candidates for treatment, we’ll create a summary report using the Auto 97th<a href="../../PCLandscapeEval/LandSummaryAbout.htm"> Summary</a>, this will automatically populate a Landscape Fire Behavior model with 97th percentile moisture conditions based on the Remote Automatic Weather Station (RAWS) nearest our area (see <a href="../../PCLandscapeEval/Auto97Summary.htm" target="_blank">Auto 97th Technical details</a> for more information on this process). This will generate both a report, and a mapped output. We'll look at the mapped output.</p>
        <p>To begin, go back to the Landscape Evaluation stage of the planning cycle, select the Landscape Summary task:&#160;</p>
        <p>For your Landscape, specify a starting landscape to represent fie behavior on an untreated landscape as it currently exists. For this tutorial, we'll select the Existing Condition landscape we just created:&#160;'HaypressCrkLF2012EC'</p>
        <p>Once you have specified your landscape, and (optional) Area of Interest, select <span class="UIcomponent">Request a Report</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/Summary_in_cycle_525x231.png" alt="Landscape Summary page with a 'request a report' botton to the right." style="width: 525;height: 231;" />
        </p>
        <p>A prompt will appear with the name of your landscape across the top. Select <span class="UIcomponent">Create Report</span> to generate the summary report.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/summary_report_prompt_461x219.png" title="text in a pop up window promts you to create a summary reoprt" style="width: 461;height: 219;" />
        </p>
        <p>The <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/hourglass.png" alt="hourglass" /> icon indicates the summary is being generated. You can refresh and check the status with the refresh button <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/button_refresh.png" alt="refresh button" />.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/summary_confirmation_340x196.png" alt="green confirmation text box appears to let you know your summary is being generated" style="width: 340;height: 196;" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>Depending upon landscape size, your summary may take a few minutes to complete.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Your Summary may be viewed from <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, in the same folder as the landscape you chose to summarize, you may also view your summary outputs in <span class="GeneralMapStudio">Map Studio</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/viewreport_656x196.png" alt="summary report is listed with other files for your landscape in MyWorkspace" style="width: 656;height: 196;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once your summary is created, navigate to <span class="UIcomponent">My Workspace</span>, and view the fire behavior outputs in <span class="GeneralMapStudio">Map Studio</span> by selecting the 'Haypress LF2012 EC - Auto97th model output file. Use the <span class="UIcomponent">Layer List</span> and <span class="UIcomponent">Zoom</span> to evaluate fire behavior across your landscape. For this example we'll focus on the Sierra City wildand urban interface in the northeast area of the map.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/tutorial_1_comparison/SierraCity_694x624.png" alt="mapped landscape with Sierra City highlighted for a closer look" style="width: 694;height: 624;" />
        </p>
        <div class="notificationTip">
            <p>As you evaluate your landscape you may find it helpful to adjust the layer transparency using the <span class="UIcomponent">more options</span> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/landscapesumm/button_moreoptions.png" alt="moreoptionsbutton" /> to the right of your fire behavior layer, and the different <span class="UIcomponent">basemap gallery</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_basemapglry.png" alt="basemap gallery button" />options.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Toggling through the fire behavior attributes of flame length, and canopy fire, we can see some areas north of town, and east between the North Yuba River and some scattered structures that could make good candidates for treatment. In this example you'll notice the circled areas indicate potentially high flame lengths, rates of spread, active crown fire, and a max spread direction moving north to northeast.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You may also use the <span class="UIcomponent">Landscape Tools</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_landscapetools.png" alt="landscape tools button" class="button" /> button to add the landscape file to <span class="GeneralMapStudio">Map Studio</span>, and the <span href="../../MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank" class="UIcomponent"><a href="../../MapStudio/Functions/Swipe.htm" target="_blank">Swipe</a></span> tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/mapstudio/button_slider.png" alt="swipe tool button" class="button" /> to view the different landscape layers and fire behavior attributes.</p>
        <p>In the next steps, we'll create shapefiles for these areas, then use those shapefiles to specify which part of the landscape to simulate our treatment alternatives for comparison.</p>
